# Colors are represented as lists of red, green and blue light intensities. 
# Here are some common colors: 
white   = make_color(255, 255, 255)
black   = make_color(0, 0, 0)
red     = make_color(255, 0, 0)
green   = make_color(0, 255, 0)
blue    = make_color(0, 0, 255)
yellow  = make_color(255, 255, 0)

# Uncomment this next line to see yellow: 
# show_color(yellow) 

# Question 3 - write your code to answer the question below

# 
# show_image("rotunda.gif") 
# make_photomosaic("rotunda.gif", "tiles/", closer_color) 

# When you're done, if you know how to make GIF images, copy an GIF image
# of yourself or your friends over "portrait.gif" and uncomment these
# next lines: 
# 
# show_image("portrait.gif")
