# Photomosaic
In doing research on this project, I ran across Sameep Tandon's ([Sameep Tandon on GitHub](https://github.com/sameeptandon)) photomosaic creator. It's one of the better photomosaic generators I've found.

##### Below is a photomosaic output from Sameep Tandon's photomosaic creator - mosaic.Sameep.py.
